user model:
The default Django user uses:
USERNAME_FIELD = "username"
But modern applications use:
    Email-based login
    Phone number login
    No username at all

TODO:
Send welcome email
Create user profile
Log activity

user verification link.
    User registers

    UserService.create_user()

    Generate verification token

simple jwt life cycle:

Step-by-Step: How request.user Is Determined
1️⃣ Client Sends Request

Example request:

GET /api/profile
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
2️⃣ DRF Authentication Middleware Runs

Because in settings.py you configured:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": (
        "rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication",
    )
}

DRF will use Simple JWT.

3️⃣ DRF Extracts the Token

From this header:

Authorization: Bearer <token>

It extracts:

<token>
4️⃣ Token Signature Verification

The library verifies the token using your Django SECRET_KEY.

It checks:

signature valid?
token expired?
token type correct?

If any of these fail → 401 Unauthorized.

5️⃣ Payload Is Decoded

If the token is valid, the payload is decoded:

{
  "user_id": "9"
}
6️⃣ DRF Fetches the User From Database

The authentication class runs something like:

User.objects.get(id=payload["user_id"])

Now DRF has the actual user object.

7️⃣ request.user Is Assigned

DRF sets:

request.user = user
request.auth = token

Now inside your view you can access:

request.user

Example:

def get(self, request):
    print(request.user.email)
🧠 Important Security Detail

Even though the token contains:

"user_id": 9

DRF still queries the database to load the user.

This ensures:

user still exists

user not disabled

user permissions still valid





Your backend now supports:

User Registration
Email Verification
Login (JWT)
Profile Retrieval
Profile Update
Service Layer Architecture
Signals
Transactions



Next Feature (Day 3 Advanced)
Next we should implement Password Reset Flow, which includes:
Forgot password
Email reset link
Token validation
Set new password

This will teach you:

token-based security

time-limited links

email flows

safe password handling
